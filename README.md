# Ten-I-See

A tribute to my best friend from the Volunteer State, which recently adopted a very silly online logo. Perfect for being intentionally annoying, or setting the mood on College Gameday. Also a fun exercise in dom manipulation with vanilla JS. <a href="http://bigbosssr.github.io/Ten-I-See/index.html"> http://bigbosssr.github.io/Ten-I-See/index.html</a>

Music: "Rocky Top" as performed by the U of Tennessee marching band. Forever.
